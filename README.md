Investment options
1) Bitcoin DCA (Dollar‑Cost Averaging)
Buy a fixed amount of BTC at a regular interval (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of price.
	•	Best for: Long‑term believers who don’t want to time the market.
	•	Benefits: Reduces impact of volatility; easy to automate; historically strong adoption.
	•	Risks: Prolonged drawdowns; regulatory changes; custody mistakes.
Example: ₦50,000 every week for 52 weeks. Total ₦2.6M invested; your BTC amount depends on prices across the year.
2) ETH + Staking (with risk controls)
Buy Ether for the Ethereum network and optionally stake via a reputable provider to earn rewards.
	•	Best for: Folks who want exposure to smart‑contract ecosystems.
	•	Benefits: Potential staking yield; broad developer activity.
	•	Risks: Smart‑contract risk; slashing/validator risk; changing yields.
Tip: Prefer self‑custody + native staking if you understand it; otherwise use diversified/liquid options and never chase “too‑good” yields.
3) Diversified Crypto Basket
Allocate across a small basket (e.g., BTC, ETH, and a limited set of large‑cap assets) with periodic rebalancing.
	•	Best for: Reducing single‑asset risk while staying in crypto.
	•	Benefits: Exposure to multiple narratives; smoother ride than 1 coin.
	•	Risks: Correlated drawdowns; some assets may underperform or fail.
Example split: 60% BTC • 30% ETH • 10% “research picks” rebalanced quarterly.
4) Stablecoin Yield (conservative‑ish)
Convert local currency to reputable USD‑pegged stablecoins and earn yield via low‑risk venues.
	•	Best for: People seeking lower volatility income in crypto.
	•	Benefits: Smaller price swings; simple to track.
	•	Risks: De‑peg risk; counterparty/platform risk; regulatory actions.
Rule: Never put all stablecoins on one platform; split across two or more and monitor regularly.
5) Learn‑to‑Earn (no‑capital start)
Use education platforms, testnets, and bounties to earn small crypto amounts while learning.
	•	Best for: Absolute beginners and students.
	•	Benefits: Build skill; minimal capital risk.
	•	Risks: Time cost; scams; changing program rules.
